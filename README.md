# rasterInfoR v.0.1
raster info tool based on shiny and the raster R package

--- 

This is the first demo release of the rasterInfoR Tool which was designed for the purpose of simplifying your raster analysis from inside R without having to switch to other software tools.

## These are the features of the current release: (v.0.1):
- A basemap that snaps to the location of your raster to give you more information on the geograpic context and land cover of your raster image.
- Value tool (similar to the QGIS Plugin): Click on your raster and get the corresponding values in a time-series plot and table.
- Raster properties: Get an overview on the projection and the resolution of your raster.
- Time Series filtering preview: Overlay the time-series plot with two filtering algorithms: Savitky-Golay and Whittaker.

More features will be available soon.
